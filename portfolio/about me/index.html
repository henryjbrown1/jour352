        <h2>My story:</h2>
        <p>I'm a senior at the University of Maryland studying Journalism as well as Government & Politics, and I hope
            to make the jump into full-time journalism once I graduate.</p>
        <p>I've spent the last few years testing my boundaries within the world of writing, first getting into the
            industry after acting on my desire to get involved in sports. I spun a few entry-level media relations
            internships into several beats covering on-campus sports such as men's basketball, baseball and women's
            soccer. I got a good, clean look at how to structure and polish a story before learning how to include
            intrigue with my reporting, interviewing and data-driven fact-finding, and have only expanded from the UMD
            sports circuit. Last summer's County Sports Zone internship reporting on high school sports within the state
            turned into a PressBoxOnline gig in the fall, all while I undertook a Washington Wizards reporting job with
            The Lead that I maintained through the spring.</p>
        <p>This recent summer and current fall have seen me take on several gigs as an intern and freelance sports
            journalist with the Capital Gazette and The Baltimore Sun, respectively. I've spent much of that time
            covering events surrounding the DMV, whether it's regularly covering Annapolis Blues soccer games or
            traveling to a western Maryland high school soccer game for a standalone feature.</p>
        <p>Basketball has maintained as my speciality through my writing and fanhood, inspiring me to start my own daily
            NBA blog in which I place a spotlight on some supporting player for each day of the season. I'm still
            working on increasing my site's traffic, but it's a great way to keep my writing and analytical muscles
            moving.</p>
