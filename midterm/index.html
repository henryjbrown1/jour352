                    <h4><b>
                            The birth of southern slang </b>
                    </h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As a fan of hip hop etymology, I looked for Outkast's role as potential inventors of slang.
                        Turns out
                        that there's definitely a case for Outkast first-use of "crunk" and "skeet".

                    </p>
                    <p>What I never realized is that this is consistent with Outkast's position as the face of southern
                        hip
                        hop - "crunk" and "skeet" both originated from the south. Southern themes in hip hop are
                        intimately
                        connected to Outkast's legacy.</p>
                    <p>Here's why: before Outkast, southern hip hop was jokingly called “country s---” by
                        east/west-coast
                        constituencies. People began to take the South more seriously when Outkast won the '95 Source
                        award
                        for best new group. During the acceptance speech, the east/west-coast's lack of respect for the
                        south revealed itself in the form of boos from the audience.</p>
                    <p>Big Boi paid tribute to New York and “all the original MCs,” but Andre decided to rant, "I'm
                        tired of
                        the close-minded folks. We got a demo tape and no one wants to hear it. But the south got
                        something
                        to say—that's all I got to say."</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4><b>Outkast's southern sound: ATL strip clubs, guitar riffs, and aliens</b></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond ATL slang, Outkast's first four albums contain copious drawl and references to Atlanta
                        (strip
                        clubs, projects, neighborhoods, intersections, Cadillacs), creating a sound that was distinctly
                        southern.</p>
                    <p>There are countless anecdotes that Atlanta was absolutely captivated by Outkast's early music.
                        Their
                        music was heard on every street-corner and from cars driving by. Intersections and businesses
                        referenced in the songs gained popularity. There's even evidence of Puff Daddy directing Playa's
                        Ball (Outkast's first single in '94) and bringing Kangol hats back to NYC.</p>

                        Extraterrestrial</a>
                    <br>
                    <p>Outkast's sound became even more distinct when they began producing their own music on ATLiens
                        (their
                        second album). These self-produced songs are about aliens, stars, and Nuwabian Nation—just about
                        as
                        far as you can get from the glorification of pimps, guns, and drugs (east/west-coast themes).
                    </p>
                    <p>Rather than emulate the east/west-coast sound and image, Outkast brought a totally new approach
                        to
                        hip hop. From the beginning, Big Boi and Andre prided themselves on originality (hence the name,
                        Outkast - to be different from the rest of the hip hop scene). “Skeet" and “crunk” were just
                        part of
                        what Outkast's southern roots brought to hip hop.</p>

                        their music frequently references neighboring communities, such as College Park and Decatur, or

                    <h4><b>The evolution of Outkast's lyrical themes</b></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>With Outkast's second album, their lyrics shifted to a completely new style, filled with
                        positivity,
                        non-violence, southern-life hardship, and guitar riffs. The next album (Aquemini) would take
                        that
                        even further, focusing on drug addiction, poverty, and morality.</p>
                    <p>While this helped Outkast create a distinctive sound, it also reflected the events in their
                        lives.
                        What makes Outkast unique isn't just their role in Southern hip hop, but unparalleled longevity
                        - 6
                        outstanding albums across 12 years - chronicling their evolution from kids to adults, players to
                        fathers, and relationships to break ups.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Each album is filled with cues for what Andre and Big Boi were experiencing at the time of its
                        production.</p>
                    <p>These events help explain the positive themes that begin on Outkast's second album: Andre makes
                        big
                        personal changes, adopting veganism and leaving the drinking/drugs lifestyle. By Aquemini, he's
                        experimenting with new musical styles and growing tired of rapping.</p>

                    <img src="img/approach.png" alt="Chart" class="img-fluid">
                    <br>
                    <p>This is an obvious over-simplification and should convey Andre's movement away from hip hop - not
                        Boi
                        Boi lack of experimentation. In fact, Big Boi's recent solo work has taken several experimental
                        directions, helping fans clearly identify his role on early Outkast tracks.</p>
                    <p>What's seemingly overlooked is Andre and Big Boi's creative genius despite an increasingly
                        divergent
                        approach to music. Or as Big Boi puts it, "two unique, individual styles meshed together to make
                        one
                        monster mayhem musical mashup.”</p>
                    <p>Andre is experimenting and growing beyond hip hop, yet Big Boi is perfectly content with
                        maintaining
                        the gangsta persona. Naturally, this creative tension leads to breakup rumors, a major theme
                        represented on Aquemini. The two debate how long they can continue to make music together with
                        such
                        opposing styles, regardless of how ground-breaking the "musical mashup" is for hip hop.</p>
                    <p>The first time Andre started to croon and modulate his voice, there's this anecdote from an
                        interview:</p>
                    <p>The first time I did it, [Big] kinda pulled me to the side and said, 'I just wanna let you know
                        niggas in the street, they don't be liking when you do your voice like that.' But to me, in my
                        head,
                        I was like it sounds cool. Maybe I'm not transmitting it right but this is cool. So that really
                        kinda gave me a push and I think my songwriting abilities were pushed in that way.</p>

                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <p>You hear this creative tension throughout Aquemini and Stankonia. When Outkast produced B.O.B.,
                        Big
                        Boi worried that their base, hardcore hip hop fans in ATL's hardest neighborhoods, would reject
                        the
                        heavy rock guitar riffs. Fortunately, the result was a net gain in fans who were traditionally
                        non-hip-hop.</p>
                    <p>Andre and Big Boi's creative differences tragically climax on Speakerboxxx, with Andre and Big
                        Boi at
                        their most distant (and coincidentally, height of popularity). If you're an Outkast fan from the
                        beginning, you see stylistic differences continue to compound. As early as Aquemini ('98), they
                        admitted that they would pursue solo works after their next album. After Idlewild's completion
                        in
                        '06, a hiatus is almost inevitable. When Andre says he's tired of hip hop and rapping, the
                        experiment ran its course.</p>
                    <p>This sheds light on the motivations for an Outkast reunion in 2014. It wasn't the reunion of two
                        out-of-the-spotlight rappers. It's wasn't an Outkast needs to get paid tour. It wasn't Andre and
                        Big
                        Boi failed at solo either. Andre and Big are interconnected souls, whose lives are documented
                        across
                        six albums. History suggests that the "reunion" was part of their plan, and it shouldn't be
                        viewed
                        as the reconciliation of a shocking break-up.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4><b>Effect on the trajectory of hip hop, pop music</b></h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>When Outkast won a Grammy in '04 for Speakerboxxx, Andre lamented in the acceptance speech,
                        "People
                        thought our first album was Stankonia. It's Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik." While Outkast was
                        at
                        their peak of popularity in '04, few people appreciated (or even knew of) their first three
                        albums
                        (that's 10 years of Outkast music history).</p>

                    <p>In particular, Aquemini ('98) scored a perfect rating from the Source. At this point, Outkast's
                        attempts to be unique achieved impressive results: a new sub-genre/sound (the dirty south) and
                        ascendancy in hip hop.</p>
                    <p>While Andre may have felt that Outkast's previous work didn't get enough respect, Stankonia was a
                        breakthrough moment for hip hop - full acceptance of the genre by the music establishment. It
                        was a
                        huge step away from traditional hip hop, borrowing heavily from George Clinton-Funk, jazz,
                        blues,
                        and rock. As Andre experimented with rock and Big Boi held onto his hardcore hip hop style, they
                        had
                        the ingredients to make their version of hip hop palatable to a mainstream audience and attract
                        new
                        fans to the genre.</p>
