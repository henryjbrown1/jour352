            The NBA Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given
            since the 1955/56 season to the best performing player of the regular season. Since the 2022/23 season,
            winners receive the Michael Jordan Trophy, named for the five-time MVP often considered to be the greatest
            player in NBA history.

            Every player who has won this award and deemed eligible for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame
            has been inducted. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the award a record six times.[6] He is also the only player to
            win the award despite his team not making the playoffs in the 1975/76 season. Both Bill Russell and Michael
            Jordan won the award five times, while Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won the award four times. Russell
            and James are the only players to have won the award four times in five seasons. Moses Malone, Larry Bird,
            Magic Johnson and Nikola Jokić each won the award three times, while Bob Pettit, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan,
            Steve Nash, Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo won it twice. Russell, Chamberlain, and Bird are the
            only players to win the award in three consecutive years. Only two rookies have won the award: Chamberlain
            (1959/60) and Wes Unseld (1968/69).[9] Seven players who won MVP (combining for eleven total awards) are
            considered "international players" by the NBA: Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria,[b] Duncan of the U.S. Virgin
            Islands,[c] Nash of Canada,[d] Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Antetokounmpo of Greece, Jokić of Serbia, and
            Embiid of Cameroon.

        <h2>Unique cases</h2>
        <p>Stephen Curry (2015/16) is the only player to have won the award unanimously. Shaquille O'Neal (1999/2000)
            and LeBron James (2012/13) are the only two players to have fallen one vote shy of a unanimous selection,
            both receiving 120 of 121 votes. Since the 1975/76 season, only three players have been named MVP for a
            season in which their team failed to win at least 50 regular season games—Moses Malone (twice, 1978/79 and
            1981/82), Russell Westbrook (2016/17) and Nikola Jokić (2021/22).</p>
